# pricecheck

Just my first app with Flutter. Trying things out.
This app compares two prices, for example when you are in the supermarket.

Future plan to this price check is the addition to use the camera to scan the prices more quickly.

Other plans is to develop a general tools app, where you can switch between tools like this. I already did something similar on my personal website. [It should look like this at the end](https://mft14.github.io/tools/)





# Building

To build, Flutter needs to be correctly installed. [Check this out here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

After a successful installation, open your terminal and type `flutter version`. It should print out the version numbers, etc.

Now you can easily build this application by cloning this repository, change into that cloned directory and type `flutter build web` for example to export as web. For android, the SDKs must be installed. For other operation systems, I can not provide any informations yet, as I don't use them for developing.
